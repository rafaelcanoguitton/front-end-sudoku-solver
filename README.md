# Front-end-sudoku-solver

This repository was created with the intent of storing Programming Languages' (CS341) final project's front end. This project is setup to use [rafaelcanougitton::sudoku-solver](https://github.com/rafaelcanoguitton/sudoku-solver), running it and displaying it's output.

# Requirements

This project requires the following installed and executable via command line to function properly:

- [git](https://git-scm.com)

- [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

It requires git to clone the base haskell code from the aformentioned repository and cabal to run it.

# Build

This is a **Node.js** project made using **electron.js** and **Create React App** and can be built using either **yarn** or **npm** simply do a

```bash
npm install
```

Followed by:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build script will take care of making a **CRA** static files build and finally bundle it along **electron**.
